# DestinyLoreOrganization
This is a simple program meant to extract all data from the Ishtar Collective's API for Destiny Lore and organize it as I see fit. Meant entirely for a personal project.

# Setup
1. Open a terminal in the folder.
2. Use these commands, in order:
  - `pipenv install`
  - `pipenv shell`
  - `python main.py` or `python main.py --web` (if you run with `--web`, the bot will host a simple web page at `http://localhost:7777`)
